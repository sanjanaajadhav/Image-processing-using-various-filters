Image Processing Project

This project focuses on exploring and implementing various image processing techniques in Python. The primary areas of investigation include:

Transformations: Log transformation, gamma transformation, binarization, and negative image.
Filtering: Average, mean, Gaussian, and median filtering.
By understanding and applying these techniques, the project aims to gain insights into image manipulation and enhancement.
